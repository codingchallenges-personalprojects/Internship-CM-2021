# Critical Mass- Internship 2021

# Work / Project Examples:
Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you’ve recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project:
**All of the projects in my resume are personal projects and I don’t have any professional experience, and they mainly focus on Java Script and its frame work React.js.
**Expensify App: using React/Redux and Firebase.
**Node.js Weather App: an app with node.js which uses express as its web server.
**widgets-app-react: an app with React Hooks.

# Inspiration
Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open-source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.
***Expensify-app:
Using React/Redux and firebase as a database. This app is one of the most challenging projects I did, because it was the first time I used a database in my project to store the data in. I practiced concepts such as CRUD operation on database and authentication with Google Auth in this project. I also learnt how to deploy a projects on Herokou for the first time.

**Nodejs-weather-app
In this app for the first time I worked with back-end and it helped me to find out the concepts of server side and client side. It also gave me good ideas about the connection between server side and client side (using express). Deploying this app was really challenging because for the first time I deployed a back-end app.

**widgets-app-react
In this app I learned about the Hooks in react, and I really like the way it works and the way data is passing between components. Using Hooks helped me to understand how to have component-level state management on a functional component (while before Hooks we had access to the state on class-based components)

# Focus
#if you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.
***The reason I decided to do a backend project was my curiosity about the server-side and client-side and the way they connect. So I did a project with Node.js and express. If I was given two options of front-end and back-end to select I would select front-end, because I believe that I have a lot to learn in this field and I am very curious about the way it works in big scale projects. If I am given time in the internship, I would dive into JS (React/Redux/Hooks/Context) concepts and practice more and more to be a professional JS programmer.
